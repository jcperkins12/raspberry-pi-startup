# RaspberryPi_Startup
This is a repo of scripts and notes that I am writing for myself to try to remember how I set up my raspberry pi and to document what worked and what didn't work.

I am by no means knowledgable in Linux/Unix systems and this is very likely not the best way to do anything, but it is the way that I found to clobber my device into a configuration that works for my purposes.
