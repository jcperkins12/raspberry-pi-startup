# Scripts to attempt to install the rippled server on a raspberry pi

Ideally the scripts can be run in order with the user just updating their ~/.profile file to reflect the location of BOOST_ROOT after [02_build_boost](02_build_boost.sh) completes but in reality these may just be a template for the user to run manual commands and adjust as necessary

Run the scripts/commands from a x64 terminal
* if using the rasbian-nspawn-64 os then use the x64 debian terminal which can be opened with "`ds64-shell`"
