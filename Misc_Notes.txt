#my xstartup file currently looks like this
```
#!/bin/sh

xrdb $HOME/.Xresources

# The following settings are to start the LXDE desktop
xsetroot -solid grey
#x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title "$VNCDESKTOP Desktop" &
#x-window-manager &
# Fix to make GNOME work
#export XKL_XMODMAP_DISABLE=1
#/etc/X11/Xsession

# for the LXDE desktop
#lxterminal &
#/usr/bin/lxsession -s LXDE &

# For the XFCE desktop

# the xfce desktop seems to use 100 mb more ram than the lxde desktop but is way easier to use


# need to set the wifi
# while logged into the computer, make sure that the "Connect automatically" and "Available to all users" boxes are checked for the wifi name
